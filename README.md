# Book Review API

This project was forked from an old github account that i used during college.
Originally used to pass a JS course from coursera.

## Project description

Project features: 
- add, edit and delete book reviews 
- Visualize book reviews
- Visualize books
- some functionalities are limited to user login (Yes, we have a login!).

This project works as an API server (at the moment it modifies a json stored on the same project)
but in the future i am planning to add an actual database and implement the networking with kubernetes and docker
